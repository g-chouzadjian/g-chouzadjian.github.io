> TDD helps us follow agile principles by delivering iteratively and refactoring often.

## The cycle

- Write a small test for a small amount of desired behaviour.
- Check the test fails with a meaningful error message.
- Write the minimal amount of code to make the test pass.
- Refactor.
- Repeat.
